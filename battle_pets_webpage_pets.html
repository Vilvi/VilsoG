                <p>Above you can see the breeds available to the Unborn Val'ky, as you can see they only have one breed, which, even though it's a mixed breed it has a very high health pool, but sacrifices a lot of speed.</p>
                <div>
                    <p>Sacrifcing speed as a haunt user however, is not a big problem since taking a hit before you get the <img class="ability_icon" src="ability_warlock_haunt.jpg" /> <a class="ability_link" href="http://www.wowhead.com/pet-ability=652/haunt">Haunt</a> off can be a huge benefit.</p>
